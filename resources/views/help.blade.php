The product catalog is central to the strategy of an ecommerce website. It must allow your visitor to quickly identify the products that interest him, give him if possible a certain feeling of completeness in what is proposed to him without making his choice difficult.

Define product categories
This is the first step in building your product catalog. Specify in your specifications all categories of products that are proposed to be offered on your ecommerce website, as well as how they impact the presentation and distribution of products. Can one product be present in more than one category? Is there a hierarchy in your categories? In which case, does the parent category present all the products of the girls categories? These are all questions that must be answered precisely in the specifications of your ecommerce site.
Product categorization can play an important role in the SEO performance that you can expect from your ecommerce site. If you want to create real semantic silos on your site, it may be relevant to specify in your specifications that these categories must impact the URL structure of your site. Feel free to test your future provider by asking him to give you a detailed feedback on how he intends to structure your product catalog to optimize the SEO of your ecommerce website.
